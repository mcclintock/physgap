# Pressure

Pressure is simply a measure of the force per unit area

$$P=\frac{F}{A}$$

Where $P$ is the pressure, and $F$ is the force applied normal to the
area $A$. Pressure is a scalar quantity. The SI unit of pressure is
the pascal, which has the symbol Pa. One pascal corresponds to a
pressure of one newton of force per square meter. To put this number
in perspective, normal atmospheric pressure is around 100 kPa at seal
level.
