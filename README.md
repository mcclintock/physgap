Phonegap App for a trial first year physics course at UQ.

The webapp itself is self contained in the www directory. This is the
directory phonegap build will look for.

The webapp (www directory) is compiled from various sources using
Hakyll. This allows templates, markdown and a whole bunch of other
stuff.
